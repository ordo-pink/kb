# Activity Bar

ActivityBar is the main entry into different application views. Activity is responsible for filling containers with suitable components.
For instance, Editor activity enables Editor component inside Workspace container and FileExplorer component inside SideBar container.

Activities can be extended by exporting an activity in the extension module. It is recommended to have one activity at maximum per
extension.
